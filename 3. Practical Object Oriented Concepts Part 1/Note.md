# Note:

1. In the 1970s, the first version of the Smalltalk programming language was developed at Xerox PARC by Alan Kay, Dan Ingalls and Adele Goldberg. **Smalltalk-72** included a programming environment and was dynamically typed, and at first was interpreted, not compiled.

2. Each object has a pointer to its class definition.

3. If we want to relate **polymorphism** to nature we can think as a woman is saying  "speak" and the differet differnet pets are responding in their own way.
