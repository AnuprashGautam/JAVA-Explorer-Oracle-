# JAVA Ecosystems:

- **Java Card**: Java Card technology provides a secure environment for applications that run on smart cards and other devices with very limited memory and processing capabilities. Multiple applications can be deployed on a single card, and new ones can be added to it even after it has been issued to the end user. Java Card technology allows the development of small Java-based applications (applets) that can be executed on a smart card. It is widely used in SIM cards and ATM cards.

- **Java ME**: Java Platform, Micro Edition (Java ME) provides a robust, flexible environment for applications running on embedded and mobile devices in the Internet of Things: micro-controllers, sensors, gateways, mobile phones, personal digital assistants (PDAs), TV set-top boxes, printers and more. Java ME includes flexible user interfaces, robust security, built-in network protocols, and support for networked and offline applications that can be downloaded dynamically. Applications based on Java ME are portable across many devices, yet leverage each device's native capabilities.

- **Java SE**: Java Platform, Standard Edition (Java SE) lets you develop and deploy Java applications on desktops and servers. Java offers the rich user interface, performance, versatility, portability, and security that today's applications require. Java SE includes classes that support the development of Java Web Services and provides the foundation for Java Platform, Enterprise Edition (Java EE).

- **Java MP**: Java Platform, Micro Profile (MP) is a baseline platform definition that optimizes Java EE for a microservices architecture and delivers application portability across multiple Micro Profile runtimes. The Micro Profile project is a collaboration between members of the Java community and vendors to optimize Enterprise Java for a microservices architecture. The Micro Profile project is a collaboration between members of the Java community and vendors to optimize Enterprise Java for a microservices architecture. The Micro Profile project is a collaboration between members of the Java community and vendors to optimize Enterprise Java for a microservices architecture.

- **Java EE**: Java Platform, Enterprise Edition (Java EE) is the standard in community-driven enterprise software. Java EE is developed using the Java Community Process, with contributions from industry experts, commercial and open source organizations, Java User Groups, and countless individuals. Java EE is developed under the Java Community Process. Java EE includes several API specifications, such as JDBC, RMI, e-mail, JMS, web services, XML, etc., and defines how to coordinate them. Java EE also features some specifications unique to Java EE for components. These include Enterprise JavaBeans, Connectors, servlets, JavaServer Pages, etc.

# Notes:

 JAVA works on the principle of "Write Once, Run Anywhere" (WORA). It means that the code written in JAVA can run on any platform that supports JAVA without any modifications.

# Java Code Structure:

1. **Class**: A class is a blueprint for objects. A class can have fields, methods, constructors, etc.

2. **Package**: A package is a namespace that organizes a set of related classes and interfaces. Conceptually, packages can be thought of as similar to different folders on your computer.

3. **Module**: High level grouping of code and data. It is a collection of packages. Introduced in JAVA 9.

# Java APIs:

1. **Java Persistence API (JPA)**: JPA is a Java application programming interface specification that describes the management of relational data in applications using Java Platform, Standard Edition and Java Platform, Enterprise Edition.

2. **Java IO API**: Java IO API is used to perform input and output (I/O) in Java. Java IO API contains classes and interfaces to read and write data.

3. **Java Stream API**: Java Stream API is used to process collections of objects. A stream is a sequence of objects that supports various methods that can be pipelined to produce the desired result.
